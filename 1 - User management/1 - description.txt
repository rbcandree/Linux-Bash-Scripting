Create a bash script to perform user management tasks as outlined below:
    - Create a new group. Each group must have a unique name. The script must check to ensure that no duplicate group names exist on the system. 
If a duplicate is found, an error needs to be reported, and the administrator must try another group name.
    - Create a new user. Each user must have a unique name. The script must check to ensure that no duplicate usernames exist on the system. 
If a duplicate is found, an error needs to be reported and the administrator must try another username. The user will have a Bash login shell and belong to the group that was created in the previous step.
    - Create a password for each user that is created.
    - Ensure that the new user created is a member of the new group created.
    - Create a directory at the root / of the file system with same name as the user created.
    - Set the ownership of the directory to the user and group created.
    - Set the permissions of the directory to full control for the owner and full control for the group created.
    - Set the permissions to ensure that only the owner of a file can delete it from the directory. This is what the "sticky bit" or "restricted deletion flag" on a directory is for.
    - Ensure that the script is executable (1st line of the script should be: #!/bin/bash ; give executable permission for all with command chmod a+x groupuseradd.sh).

This script should be designed to accept any username and any group name. DO NOT hardcode commands to create specific usernames and group names.
Hints:
    - Logical order is important.
    - There is a special wildcard that can be used to determine if the previous command is successful or not: $.
